# File manager

Welcome to the 3rd week of the journey!

This week we are going to wrap up the file system utilities from the previous week.

## Week 3 Tasks Overview

### 1. File manager CLI basic functional requirements

The file manager should be able to do the following:

- Work using CLI
- Read and save user configuration to the `.config` file in the root project directory
- Perform basic file operations:
    - Copy
    - Move
    - Delete
    - Rename
- Utilize the Streams API
- Get information about the host machine operating system
- Perform hash calculations
- Compress and decompress files

Run the application using:

```bash
npm run start -- --username=your_username
```

#### Application Behavior

- After starting the program, it displays the following text in the console:

  ```
  Welcome to the File Manager, Username!
  ```
  (Where `Username` is the value passed as the `--username` CLI argument.)

- After the program finishes (when `CTRL + C` is pressed or `.exit` command is entered), it displays:

  ```
  Thank you for using File Manager, Username, goodbye!
  ```

- At startup and after each operation or input, the current working directory is printed in the following format:

  ```
  You are currently in path_to_working_directory
  ```

- The initial working directory is the current user's home directory. For example, on Windows, it might be `system_drive/Users/Username`.

#### Command Prompt Behavior

- By default, the program prompts users to enter commands and waits for input.
- On receiving an invalid input or unknown operation, it displays:

  ```
  Invalid input
  ```

  and allows the user to enter a new command.

- If an error occurs during operation (e.g., attempting to operate on a non-existent file), it displays:

  ```
  Operation failed
  ```

  and allows for a new command to be entered.

- Users cannot navigate above the root directory (e.g., on Windows, the root is the local drive root). If attempted, the working directory remains unchanged.

### 2. List of operations and their syntax

#### Navigation & Working Directory (NWD)

- Move up one directory level (no effect at the root directory):

  ```bash
  up
  ```

- Navigate to a specified folder (relative or absolute path):

  ```bash
  cd path_to_directory
  ```

- List all files and folders in the current directory:

  ```bash
  ls
  ```

  Output includes:

    - Names of files (with extensions) and folders
    - Folders listed before files, sorted alphabetically
    - Explicit marking of file/folder type as a column value

#### Basic File Operations

- Read and display file content (uses Readable stream):

  ```bash
  cat path_to_file
  ```

- Create an empty file:

  ```bash
  add new_file_name
  ```

- Rename a file (content remains unchanged):

  ```bash
  rn path_to_file new_filename
  ```

- Copy a file (uses Readable and Writable streams):

  ```bash
  cp path_to_file path_to_new_directory
  ```

#### Operating System Information

- Get End-Of-Line (EOL) character:

  ```bash
  os --EOL
  ```

- Get CPU information (model and clock rate of each CPU, and total count):

  ```bash
  os --cpus
  ```

- Print the home directory:

  ```bash
  os --homedir
  ```

- Get the current system username (distinct from the username set at app startup):

  ```bash
  os --username
  ```

- Get CPU architecture:

  ```bash
  os --architecture
  ```

#### Hash Calculation

- Calculate and print the hash of a file:

  ```bash
  hash path_to_file
  ```
