---

## Week 7 Task overview 

### 1. Reactor API using express JS.

Follow a layered architecture approach to structure your code. 
The application should include controllers, a service layer, repositories, models, routes, and middlewares (if necessary).

### 2. Data save mode.

Implement a switchable data storage mechanism between an in-memory database and SQLite. 
Introduce a configuration key to toggle this behavior.
