# Chapter: NodeJS basics. NodeJS common modules.

Welcome to the second week of our journey.

We need to familiarize ourselves with basic Node.js filesystem packages and concepts to build upon the skills from last week. Let's dive into the exciting topics for this week!

### Task 1

## Create.js

Implement a function that creates a new file `fresh.txt` with the content "I am fresh and young" inside the `files` folder.

- If the file already exists, throw an error with the message: `FS operation failed`.

## Copy.js

Implement a function that copies the `files` folder with all its content into a folder named `files_copy` at the same level.

- If the `files` folder doesn't exist or the `files_copy` folder already exists, throw an error with the message: `FS operation failed`.

## Rename.js

Implement a function that renames the file `wrongFilename.txt` to `properFilename.md`.

- If the file `wrongFilename.txt` doesn't exist or `properFilename.md` already exists, throw an error with the message: `FS operation failed`.

## Delete.js

Implement a function that deletes the file `fileToRemove.txt`.

- If the file `fileToRemove.txt` doesn't exist, throw an error with the message: `FS operation failed`.

## List.js

Implement a function that prints an array of all filenames from the `files` folder to the console.

- If the `files` folder doesn't exist, throw an error with the message: `FS operation failed`.

## Read.js

Implement a function that prints the content of the file `fileToRead.txt` to the console.

- If the file `fileToRead.txt` doesn't exist, throw an error with the message: `FS operation failed`.

## CalcHash.js

Implement a function that calculates the SHA256 hash for the file `fileToCalculateHashFor.txt` and logs it to the console as a hexadecimal value using the Streams API.

## Compress.js

Implement a function that compresses the file `fileToCompress.txt` into `archive.gz` using `zlib` and the Streams API.

## Decompress.js

Implement a function that decompresses `archive.gz` back into `fileToCompress.txt` with the same content as before compression using `zlib` and the Streams API.

## Task 2 (optional)

Think a bit about file structure. Don't put them all in one directory.

## Task 3 

Create npm sripts to run demo of all commands. 

## Task 4 (optional)

Run your scripts in windows and linux enviromnments.

## Task 5  

Link your project with https://stackblitz.com/ for testing.
